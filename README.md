Common Types (and code) for Tachi. These are shared between the client and the server implementations.

## Unorthodox Build Process

Instead of using NPM to store this package, we just host it on github.

This is easier, but comes with the added issue that you have to actually build this codebase
with `pnpm build` before making a commit.

Maybe in the future this will be fixed, as it probably messes with multiple people
making git commits quite bad.
